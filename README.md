# Simple E-shop with Next.js and Stripe

## A Full-stack electronic shop deployed in AWS

This is a simple e-shop example. User can buy over the internet products with Stripe payment platform.

User can check the catalog of objects that are taken from Stripe. 

They can add whichever product they want to buy to the cart by clicking the "Add to cart" button on each item.

The cart object will start counting all the items that have been added.

Once the user is ready to buy, they can click on the cart button.

Once in the cart page, user can see which products they can buy.

They can either change manually or input a number in order to change the amount of items they are buying.

They can set it to zero or less in order to remove an item.

They can go back to add more if they wish, otherwise, we can proceed to the Checkout.

The checkout will allow them to use their credit card in order to pay for the products.
